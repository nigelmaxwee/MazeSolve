# MazeSolve
This project explores the use of recursion function and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to solve a maze that was in the format of a .txt file in a single array format, it was also given that the maze is in the shape of a square.

The overall logic can be seen in the figure below:

To run this program:
1. Install all dependencies required
2. Ensure that both .py file and .txt file are in the same directory
3. Run .py file (Spyder as an IDE would work the smoothest)
