# MazeSolve
This project explores the use of recursion function and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to solve a maze that was in the format of a .txt file in a single array format, it was also given that the maze is in the shape of a square.

To run this program:
1. Install all dependencies required
2. Ensure that both .py file and .txt file are in the same directory
3. Run .py file (Spyder as an IDE would work the smoothest) 

This code was done and graded as a group project for MS1008 Introduction to Computational Thinking at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) where I received an overall A grade for this module.
My contributions to this project included:
1. Coding majority of the code which includes the slicing, start and end inputs, display, and recursion portions.
2. Created the overall flowchart of the code and logic.
